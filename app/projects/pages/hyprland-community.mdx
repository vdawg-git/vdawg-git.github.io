## Website

Still a work in progress, but for now development is halted until we get more active again.

## Logo

The community should feel like a fireplace.
So in the logo I tried to incorporate that while referencing the Hyprland logo.

## Techstack

Very simple. Astro with Tailwind and vanilla JS.<br/>
Astro is simply great for mostly static sites like this.
