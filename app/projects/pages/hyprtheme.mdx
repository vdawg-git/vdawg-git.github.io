Hyprtheme is an app to easily apply themes to your Hyprland Linux desktop.

I joined the project, created the webapp and contributed to the Rust cli code. The logo is also done by me.

## Techstack

For the web-app I used Astro with and made sure that the theme images really shine, creating UI color-palette dynamically on build for eacht theme.

The development has stalled for now. The webapp is basically done though.
